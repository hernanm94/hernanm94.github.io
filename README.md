Heading Best Practices
Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (#) and the heading name. For compatibility, always put a space between the number signs and the heading name.

✅  Do this	❌  Don't do this
# Here's a Heading

#Here's a Heading
You should also put blank lines before and after a heading for compatibility.

✅  Do this	❌  Don't do this
Try to put a blank line before...

# Heading

...and after a heading.	Without blank lines, this might not look right.
# Heading
Don't do this!
Paragraphs
To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.
